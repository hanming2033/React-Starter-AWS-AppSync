// fieldName: (obj, args, context, info) => result;

// args: An object containing all of the arguments passed into the field. For example, if you called a mutation with updateNetworkStatus(isConnected: true), the args object would be { isConnected: true }.

// context: The context object, which is shared by all links in the Apollo Link chain. The most important thing to note here is that weâ€™ve added the Apollo cache to the context for you, so you can manipulate the cache with cache.writeData({}).
